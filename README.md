Striding The Journey To Data Science

Salisu M. Indabawa

As tech enthusiasts, our long days were often spent darting from one meet-up to another and participating in hackathons across various communities and institutions, all without a clear sense of what expertise I should pursue in the vast tech landscape.

Year after year, I found myself bewildered, sharing stories and challenges with like-minded peers, engaging in rhetorical self-examination to assess whether we were genuinely on the path to securing fulfilling careers in tech. Although I was very well aware of my struggle to follow a solid learning trajectory, it was only in 2019 that I felt the compelling urge to return to university to study courses in the then Department of Computer Science. This pivotal choice reignited my hope and confidence in building a diverse career in tech, blending hands-on experiences with theoretical foundations.

My past unproductive ventures had finally started to bear fruit academically and beyond. Being immersed in an academic setting exposed me to new challenges and reaffirmed my commitment to using technology to innovate and drive change in the world. Therefore ultimately solidified my interest in pursuing a career in the dynamic field of digital technology.

Through careful consideration and invaluable mentorship sessions at leading tech institutions like Ehealth Africa and CITAD, I found direction. However, as I contemplated how to incorporate data science into my advanced studies, the exciting opportunity from Arewa Data Science Academy emerged — a rare chance to reshape my long-term ambition of becoming a data scientist. Selecting a career path necessitates diligent checks and balances, a common challenge for young people today. Mentorship and guidance play crucial roles in advancing one’s journey in tech, yet only the most resilient thrive. We must reflect on our experiences, learn from the past, and strive to make the tech ecosystem more inclusive and engaging, empowering more individuals to excel and contribute to our field.
